Data used in experiments described in the paper "A COMPARISON OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS FOR GLOTTAL CLOSURE INSTANT DETECTION FROM RAW SPEECH".

An example of a Python code to train and test an InceptionV3-1D model, a deep one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN), for detecting glottal closure instants (GCIs) in the speech signal, including a brief data and detection/classification procedure description, is shown in interactive Jupyter notebook `GCI_detection.ipynb`. Please see the [official page](http://jupyter.org/) for an information on how to launch the jupyter notebook.
